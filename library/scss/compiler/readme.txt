=== SASS Compiler ===

This plugin provides automated SASS stylesheet comiling using php.

=== Usage ===

The plugin will search for .scss files within the scss folder. Any subfolders or files that start with an underscore will be overlooked. Upon update, the changes will be compiled into css and put into the css folder. If a matching file does not exist, one will be created.

Errors while compiling will be displayed on the front end.
